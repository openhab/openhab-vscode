[openHAB](http://www.openhab.org) is a vendor and techology agnostic open source automation software for your home. This [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) extension allows you to work with openHAB configuration files (like `*.items`, `*.rules`, `*.sitemap` and `*.script`) thanks to the syntax highlighting, code snippets and integrated search.

The extension is designed with openHAB 2.x in mind - most snippets and design patterns will work in openHAB 2.x

* Code snippets for openHAB, including [Design Patterns](https://community.openhab.org/tags/designpattern) by Rich Koshak
* Integrated quick search of [openHAB Community](https://community.openhab.org)

* Integrated Paper UI preview for the Items and Things
* Integration with openHAB REST API
