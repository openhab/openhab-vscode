[openHAB](http://www.openhab.org) is a vendor and techology agnostic open source automation software for your home. This [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) extension allows you to work with openHAB configuration files (like `*.items`, `*.rules`, `*.sitemap` and `*.script`) thanks to the syntax highlighting, code snippets and integrated search.

* Integrated quick search of [openHAB Community](https://community.openhab.org)
